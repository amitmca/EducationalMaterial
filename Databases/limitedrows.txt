Returning TOP N Records
APRIL 19, 2003
databases
Returning only the first N records in a SQL query differs quite a bit between database platforms. Here's some samples:

Microsoft SQL Server

SELECT TOP 10 column FROM table
PostgreSQL and MySQL

SELECT column FROM table
LIMIT 10
Oracle

SELECT column FROM table
WHERE ROWNUM <= 10
Sybase

SET rowcount 10
SELECT column FROM table
Firebird

SELECT FIRST 10 column 
FROM table
Due to these differences if you want to keep your code database independent you should use the maxrows attribute in the cfquery tag in ColdFusion. The tradeoffs to database independance is performance, I would expect maxrows to be slower than specifying the rows in the SQL.

<cfquery datasource="#ds#" maxrows="10">
SELECT column FROM table
</cfquery>
PostgreSQL and MySQL have a cool feature that will let you return an arbitrary range of rows (eg return rows 10-20). This is very handy for displaying pages of records:

SELECT column FROM table
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20
The above query will return rows 20-30

   Fredy's Simple Log Server
   -------------------------
   SimpleLogServer is a tool I did to enhance my sql-Admin package.
   http://www.hulmen.ch/admin

   SimpleLogServer is based onto java.util.logging and therefore
   needs to have in minimum jdk 1.4 underneath.

   SimpleLogServer is listenning onto a port ( default: 5237 )
   It receives java.util.logging.LogRecord and logs it into
   the default log-environment. To change file-names and LogHandlers
   see the  /usr/java/jre/lib/logging.properties file (or wherever
   this file in your OS is), so you can easily change this by giving
   the VM the parameter -Djava.util.logging.config.file= [FILE]

   Additionally it allows to display the LogRecords within a GUI if
   you launch it via -GUI parameter.

   Parameters: -p   port to listen onto (default: 5237 )
               -GUI launch GUI
               -c   Capacity of the GUI-Buffer, if capacity is reached
	            the upper half of the text is deleted. This value
	            is set per defaqult to 4096
   
   As I do not know, where to put the logging.dtd and to use it, you
   have to set gpl.fredy.tools.FxmlFormatter as the Formatter for the 
   java.util.loggin.SocketHandler.formatter. So do not forget to add
   sls.jar to you CLASSPATH.

   If someone knows a solution, I'm really interested to hear about.
   I took the ideas to the server from David Flanagans 'Java in a Nutshell'

   change your logging.properties file of the clients as follows:
   ( it is in [your-location]/jre/lib/logging.properties )

   1) add java.util.logging.SocketHandler to the handlers-property
   2) add the SocketHandler Properties as follows:
      
        java.util.logging.SocketHandler.formatter = gpl.fredy.tools.FxmlFormatter
        java.util.logging.SocketHandler.level = INFO 
        java.util.logging.SocketHandler.host =  sls-server-hostname
        java.util.logging.SocketHandler.port = 5237 
  
	(where INFO is the lowest level to log,
	       sls-server-hostname is the server running my SimpleLogServer
               port is the port you defined while starting sls.

   adapt your Server-side logging properties according your needs, as the server
   is using standard LogManager properties and creating LogRecords, it relies onto
   the standard properties.


   To test sls, just start on the server java -jar logtest.jar to have a very simple
   tester.

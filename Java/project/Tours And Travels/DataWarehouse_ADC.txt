Project Description :
		The project facilitates data access and storage from 
		Heterogeneous databases like Access & Oracle. The user
		can access data from all the databases connected to the 
	      	 warehouse. 
		The user can explicitly state the mapping
		constraints and the aggregate functions while creating the 
		Fact data. The Fact data created by each user is segregated 
		and is exclusive for each user. The user can fire queries on
		fact data and store frequently used queries. 
		The data in the warehouse can be refreshed and archived as 
		and when needed. There is also a facility to delete the fact data.
		The Meta data is allocated a separate storage area in the warehouse
		 and only	the Administrator has access to it.
